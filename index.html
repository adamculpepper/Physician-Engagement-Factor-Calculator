				<div class="panel-heading">SHARE THE VISION.</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<div class="sub">Formalize structure for ongoing dialogue at all stages of improvement.</div><br>
					Physicians need to be included in organizational performance improvement from the beginning. Communicating more of the “why” and not waiting until the “how” of the change helps shift physician view from personal accountability to systems theory of organizational improvement.<br><br>

					<u>Recommendations:</u>
					<ul>
						<li>Move from sporadic involvement (as needed, or by project) to routine, standing agenda items at med staff meetings.</li>
						<li>Develop a formal steering committee for PI/LSS comprised of hospital executives and active med staff that meets routinely to assess vision for LSS and project alignment.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="panel panel-default">
				<div class="panel-heading">CULTIVATE COMMON PURPOSE.</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<div class="sub">Select purposeful, intentional projects designed for collaboration.</div><br>
					To engage physicians from the beginning, organizations need to work on projects that address physician concerns, not primarily financial return. If the organization purposefully balances its PI portfolio of projects with ones that reduce hassle factors for physicians or improve clinical outcomes, physicians will see the value of LEAN/six sigma much sooner and advocate for even more changes.<br><br>

					<u>Recommendations:</u>
					<ul>
						<li>Survey physicians for “hassle factors” and develop a plan to systematically reduce them using LEAN tools for reducing waste.</li>
						<li>Utilize Six Sigma to solve complex clinical outcomes for patient populations (i.e. readmissions, evidence best practice bundles).</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="panel-heading">MOBILIZE COMMITMENT THROUGH THE “RIGHT” PHYSICIAN CHAMPIONS.</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<div class="sub">Look beyond formal leadership roles for physician champions.</div><br>
					While it may be “easier” for physicians with administrative roles to commit time to performance improvement initiatives, improvement success depends heavily on “influence” which may not be formalized. Any member of medical staff who is passionate about change should be empowered with change management skills to lead the organization to an improved state.<br><br>
					<u>Recommendations:</u>
					<ul>
						<li>Rotate members of medical staff on PI/LSS steering committee to systematically look for interest/passion.</li>
						<li>Recruit physicians using input from service line leaders or service chiefs for those who demonstrate passion, interest, and leadership ability.</li>

				<div class="panel-heading">EMPOWER PHYSICIAN LEADERS WITH CHANGE MANAGEMENT SKILLS.</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<div class="sub">Provide training and coaching to support your physician leaders.</div><br>
					Harnessing physicians’ natural response to the scientific method, LEAN Six Sigma follows a similar framework of evaluating and diagnosing a problem, prior to “treatment” and follow-up. However, leadership and process improvement is not taught in medical education and residency.<br><br>
					<u>Recommendations:</u>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide formal training programs in leadership, change management, and LEAN six sigma that is customized specifically for physician leaders.</li>
						<li>Support your physician leaders through coaching to boost project results and engagement.</li>

					<div class="sub">Follow through and commit to results.</div><br>
					Change is hard. Often large, complex change initiatives take time, and medical staff commitment may wane without routine project status updates. When projects are not going as designed, approach the problem with transparency. Developing trusting, actionable dialogue will assist in course correction and eliminate the “we/they” that may exist between organizations and medical staff.<br><br>
					<u>Recommendations:</u>
					<ul>
						<li>Select fewer number of projects to ensure optimal success and positive leader engagement.</li>
						<li>Communicate regularly and often, top-down and two-way, through informal and formal channels (town hall meetings, CEO memos, service line meetings, newsletters, hall hits, one-on-one).</li>
